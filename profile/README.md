### **My Philosophy**

I believe in building with intention. Whether it's architecting a secure software system, launching a new business venture, or exploring the intricacies of human psychology, my work is a practice in deliberate creation. I find value in looking at software from both a builder's and a breaker's perspective to create more robust code..
